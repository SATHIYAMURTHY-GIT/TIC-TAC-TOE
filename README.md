# TIC-TAC-TOE
ITS A TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
Here's a **brief guide and how-to-play instructions** for your *Tic Tac Toe with Bot* game:

### 🎮 **About the Game:**

**Tic Tac Toe** is a classic 2-player strategy game where players take turns placing their symbol (❌ or ⭕) in a 3×3 grid. The goal is to get **three in a row**—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does.

This version supports:

* 🎭 **2 Player Mode** – Two humans take turns.
* 🤖 **VS Bot Mode** – Play against a simple computer opponent.
* 🌙 **Light/Dark Themes** – Toggle themes using the top-right moon/sun button.
* 🎉 **GIF Celebration** – Fun animations appear after a win or draw.
* 🌀 Smooth animations and colorful borders.
